In 2023 july i join on #13 Piscine, unfortunately i fail, lost in a middle of the process. But the interess learning code still. 
So everything I leave inside this repository was done at home outside 42 Lisbon.  
I also leave at the end a link where I went to get information and learn language in C. For those who do not know W3school I recommend taking a look, doing the exercises and practicing.
